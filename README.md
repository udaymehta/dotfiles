### Arch Configuration:

Clone the repo to ~/dev/ (if you want to change the location then make sure to update the paths in `install.sh`)

```bash
mkdir -p ~/dev/

cd ~/dev/

git clone https://github.com/udaymehta/dotfiles.git
```

Before installing, have a look at the `pkgs.txt` file
Now, lets install the packages

```bash
## Packages in pkgs.txt are for arch based distros only. Install them according to your own system.
yay -S $(cat ~/dev/dotfiles/pkgs.txt | cut -d' ' -f1)
```

Now, use the install script to link the folders inside `dotfiles` to your `.config` directory.

```bash
# Note that this is an optional step. If you don't want to use it then you can manually copy paste the files like normal.
chmod +x ~/dev/dotfiles/install.sh

~/dev/dotfiles/install.sh
```

After running this, it will create a _soft link_ from the `dotfiles` to `~/.config/*` folder. Again, this was optional.

Tada! now you've installed the theme.

You can switch your session and see if it works!

> **NOTE**
>
> You may need to adjust the screen resolution and waybar widgets postion manually as they are _**most**_ likely to change on your device.
